# Heat-transfer-Finite-Difference-Problem
Finite Difference Problem %  % This code is developed to study a 2d steady state thermal problem of the form: 

Two walls are adiabatic.
                       
Using the finite difference method. A mesh convergance study can also be done  % in order to understand how the number of nodes affects the accuracy of the solution.
